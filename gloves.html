<h3 style="color:white;font-family:Consolas">A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is a garment covering the <br> whole hand. Gloves usually have separate sheaths or openings for each <br> finger and the thumb.If there is an opening but no (or a short) covering <br> sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves <br> having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger <br> are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily <br> fingerless.</h3>
